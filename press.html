    “… ‘Degrowth’ for many signifies a variety of initiatives proposing an alternative to capitalist accumulation and the reconstruction of our reproduction on more cooperative terms. This then is a volume that those committed to building non exploitative relations will need to consult as it offers a map to the world of alternatives to capitalisms.  <span class="author">— <strong>Silvia Federici</strong>, Hofstra University, Hempstead.</span>

    “At a time in history when political, economic and intellectual leaders assure us that nothing fundamental can any longer be questioned, nothing could be more important than the movement – of thought, and of action – that this volume on Degrowth represents…” <span class="author"> — <strong>David Graeber</strong>, London School of Economics, London.</span>
